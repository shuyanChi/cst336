        <span>JavaScript</span> are often reffered as JS, is a high-level,
        interpreted script language.
        Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of
        the World Wide Web.
        <i id = "shadowText">JavaScript enables interactive web pages, therefore it is
        an important part of web applications. </i>It is being used widely.
        and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and
        imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.
        It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic
        manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as
        networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host
        environment in which it is embedded.
        Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now
        embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers
        and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and
        in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop
        applications, including desktop widgets. <br /><br />
